This is a mono repo that consist of frontend and backend with stack:

- Astro (Typescript)
- React
- Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI
- Pocketbase
- Docker

Use this repo as a template. You can also setup [`action-template-sync`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/actions-template-sync) to update template with already created repo (since it's different with repo forking).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ InteractiveComponent.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BlogPage.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DashboardPage.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ LandingPage.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/backend/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pocketbase.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pocketbase-types.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ global.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ pages.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
